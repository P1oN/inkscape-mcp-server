"""Live-view loop Prompt (architecture §4.1 — the `live_canvas_assist` entry point).

A Prompt orients the agent on HOW to run the live-view loop safely; it adds ZERO authority (ADR-006)
— it issues no command and grants no capability, it merely describes the perceive→decide→act→observe
loop and the rules around it. The actual work happens through the existing typed tools, with every
mutation still gated by `run_live_mutation` (HIGH + approval).

Registered via ``@mcp.prompt`` against the shared app; the module import (wired in
``server.register_tools``) runs the decorator and self-registers the prompt.

        "(replace the selected text). There is NO raw-Action or code path.\n"

        "an `approval_token`. Mutating a running session is HIGH risk: the act is REFUSED without "
